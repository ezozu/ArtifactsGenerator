# ArtifactsGenerator

## Description

A neural network-driven NFT art generator leveraging GANs and diffusion models to produce unique, high-resolution pieces, with integrated IPFS storage and Ethereum blockchain interoperability for secure provenance tracking and decentralized marketplace integration.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtifactsGenerator software project:
- "Generates 3D mesh models from 2D image inputs using convolutional neural networks",
- "Supports customizable material properties and texture mapping for realistic rendering",
- "Utilizes physicsbased simulations to predict object behavior and interactions",
- "Provides an intuitive graphical user interface for artifact design and prototyping",
- "Includes automated testing and validation tools for generated artifacts",
- "Offers realtime collaboration features for multiuser artifact development",
- "Exports generated artifacts in various formats, including STL, OBJ, and GLTF"
- Let me know if you'd like me to adjust or add anything!
